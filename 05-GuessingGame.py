# 5 - Guessing game
# Source: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html
# Write a guessing game where the user must guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

from random import randint

print("Guess a number between 1 and 50.")
secretNum = randint(0,50)

# Take input from the user and convert to int
userGuess = int(input("Your guess: "))

alreadyGuessed = []

# While guess is wrong, take more inputs
while userGuess != secretNum:
    if userGuess < secretNum: # If guess is too low, tell the user & ask for another input
        print("Too low, try again.")
        userGuess = int(input())
        alreadyGuessed.append(userGuess) # Add the guess to an array

    elif userGuess > secretNum: # If guess is too high, tell user & ask again
        print("Too high, try again.")
        userGuess = int(input())
        alreadyGuessed.append(userGuess) # Add guess to array

# If guess is right, tell user
if userGuess == secretNum:
    print("You're right!")
    print("It took you " + str(len(set(alreadyGuessed)) + 1) + " tries.") # +1 to count the last/correct guess.
